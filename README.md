# Fillit - an Ã‰cole42 school project
This project was about coding a very rudimentary tetris-like program.
The program takes a file containing several "tetriminos" and after validating
the input, the program displays the tetriminos, each one represented with a capital
letter, placed in the smallest square possible. This project was coded in
collaboration with [Lev Askolin](https://github.com/lev9).  
To test the program with the example file I've included, after `make all`, run
the program `fillit` with `example_file.txt` as argument.
  
The library used is [libft](https://github.com/krsalmi/libft), another school project and the function to read each line of the file is [get_next_line](https://github.com/krsalmi/get_next_line).
